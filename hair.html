                        Seen as the genetic jackpot for women, 
                        an oval may not be the most alpha of 
                        face shapes for men, but it’s a good 
                        canvas for experimentation. Symmetrical 
                        and well-proportioned, an oval face shape
                        does pretty much any hairstyle justice, 
                        so – you lucky boy – the choice is very much yours.
