                    <p>
                        An oval face may not be the most masculine of 
                        face shapes for men, but it’s a good 
                        canvas for experimentation. Symmetrical 
                        and well-proportioned, an oval face shape
                        does pretty much any hairstyle justice, 
                        so the choice is very much yours.That said, 
                        there are a couple of minor caveats to ensure
                        you optimise your ovalness. “The trick with an
                        oval face shape is to wear your hair off the forehead
                        to create some volume and angles on top,” says Aveda master 
                        Stelios Nicolaou. “The most suitable style is a classic short
                        back and sides and slightly longer on the top, with a side-swept parting.”

                        Haircut For Diamond Faces
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Narrow in the chin and brow, with width in the cheeks, the diamond is one of the rarer 
                        face shapes. Because of that, it has some specialist requirements to ensure it looks its 
                        namesake. “Hairstyles that add width at the forehead and chin area are your best bet,” says
                        Stevens. “Fringes work well to add texture to the forehead, while longer styles that can be
                        tucked behind the ears are great for accentuating a diamond shape’s bone structure.”
                        Don’t, however, take the sides too short – given the width of the cheekbones, a hairstyle that’s 
                        particularly short at the sides will only make your ears look bigger. Softer lines and layers are 
                        better for this face shape, working to soften its natural angles. Try a side sweep or deep side-parting, 
                        and consider growing a 5 o’clock shadow if you want to add some size to a narrower chin.

                            Haircut For Square Faces
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            Considered the masculine ideal, a square face shape is characterised by a razor sharp jawline, 
                            even proportions and an overall chiselled appearance. Like the oval, it’s a great foundation for
                            most styles and is versatile enough to work with both extremely short and longer hairstyles – from 
                            buzz cuts to French crops to quiffs. Just bear in mind that the shorter you go, the more you look like 
                            you’ve just been conscripted. Not that that won’t serve you well. “Classic, neat haircuts complement a 
                            square shape best – think close fades, side partings and short layers,” says Stevens. Some light stubble
                            also gives the sharpness of your jawline a little welcome texture without blurring its line.

                            <p>
                            Wide at the temples and hairline, gradually narrowing to a point at the chin, the (fairly rare) 
                            heart face shape benefits from a few optical illusions to make it appear better proportioned. 
                            “Avoid cuts that are very tight, as these will accentuate the narrowness of the chin and the 
                            width of the forehead,” says Stevens. “A medium-length swept look is the safest bet.” Mid-length
                            and long hairstyles that are kept reasonably thin and light soften the heart shape’s strong forehead.
                            Facial hair is also key in this case, adding some much-needed bulk to a narrow chin and jawline, says 
                            Robinson. “As with the diamond face shape, a beard helps a heart shape gain fullness in the lower, narrower 
                            half of the head.”
